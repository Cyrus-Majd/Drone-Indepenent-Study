# Drone-Indepenent-Study

Making a Drone do search and detection automatically for mass deployment.

# Summary

The project aims to develop a drone capable of conducting autonomous search and mapping of a given area using GPS data. The team is using a DJI drone that lacks an SDK, requiring them to establish effective communication with the drone and control it via its controller. To achieve this, they have connected the controller to a Raspberry Pi and utilized its GPIO pins to manipulate the drone as if it were a joystick. The project demonstrates the team's ability to create a customized solution that effectively enables a non-programmable drone to perform complex tasks autonomously, with potential applications in fields such as surveying, mapping, and environmental monitoring.

## TO DO

    - Making the drone using ArduPilot
        - Make Drone using flight controller and connect it up to a raspberry pi
        - Get equipment
        - https://www.thingiverse.com/make:901017
        - https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:753840
    - Get a drone license
    - GPS
        - Drone can make path
        - Drone can travel path
        - Drone can edit path

    - Droning
        - Drone should be able to drone

    - Vision
        - Drone needs to be able to edit path based on what it sees
        - Drone must detect people in a certain place

    - Control
        - Drone should be able to be controlled from a API
        - Drone needs to have a way of conforming its control
        - Need to map space where drone is

## Key points

    Getting tello movements working
    PWM testing on leds
    DJI Drone no longer an option
    Turning to DIY Drone
